**Introduction**

This application streamlines the process of running AUTO1111 on Linux systems by providing a system tray icon and desktop application launcher. It solves the issue of a cluttered taskbar when running AUTO1111 in a separate terminal, integrating it seamlessly into your desktop environment.

While this should work on most Linux installations, thorough testing is needed. The system tray utilizes PyQT5, so ensure compatibility with your Linux OS before use.

**Features**

*   **System Tray Icon:** Easily access and manage a running AUTO1111 instance.
*   **Desktop Application Launcher:** Convenient way to start AUTO1111.
*   **Self-Contained:** Automatically downloads the AUTO1111 repository during setup.
*   **(Future) Guided Installer:**  Streamlined setup process.
*   **(Future) Custom Defaults:** Optimized file system configurations for improved performance.

**Requirements**

*   Linux-based operating system compatible with PyQT5.
*   Other dependencies will be installed automatically.

**Installation**

1.  Download this repository and place it in an easily accessible location on your machine.

2.  Creating an empty directory to place the `webui-desktop-app` folder inside is highly recommended for organization. The `webui-desktop-app` folder must remain in place after installation.

3.  Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `webui-desktop-app`, and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd webui-desktop-app
    python setup.py
    ```

4.  Follow the instructions in the terminal. If errors occur, attach the "webui.log" file to a bug report and provide your OS information. This project was tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with KDE Plasma and ROCm 6.0.1.

5. WebUI.sh will be ran once during setup. Afterthe browser is visible, you can cntrl+c to close the terminal generated by setup. 

6. Only press "Y" if there were errors, otherwise press "N" to complete the AUTO1111 webui appeared to function as intended (a webpage opened in yoru browser with a local host address "127.0.0.1/7860" typically).

6.  Locate the application on your Linux system and ensure it's working. A system tray icon should appear, and after 30 seconds to 3 minutes, a browser should load your Stable Diffusion interface.

7.  To exit, right-click the tray icon and select "Exit."

**Usage**

This application simplifies the installation and running of AUTO1111, eliminating the need for complex commands.

If issues arise after installation, a log file for the desktop application can be found at `/tmp/webui.log`. This is separate from the log in the `webui-desktop-app` directory and handles desktop application launch errors only.

**Contributing**

To report bugs, include your OS, version, desktop environment (Gnome, KDE, etc.), and associated log files. For desktop launcher issues, provide `/tmp/webui.log`. For installation problems, provide `webui.log` from the `webui-desktop-app` directory.

Code contributions are welcome for improvements to readability, versatility, and redundancy. Avoid adding new features at this time.
